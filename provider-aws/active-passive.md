# Configuring active-passive hub cluster

## Procedure

### On both the active and passive hub clusters:

1. You must install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management operator in the same namespace on both clusters
2. If the active hub cluster has any other operators installed, such as Ansible Automation Platform, Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, cert-manager, you have to install them also on the passive cluster.
   This ensures that the passive hub cluster is configured in the same way as the active hub cluster.
1. Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `cluster-backup` parameter to `true`.
   You can either use the graphical console for this task or run the following command line:
   ```
   oc patch MultiClusterEngine ${NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"cluster-backup","enabled":true}]}}}'
   ```
   This will install the OADP operator in the `open-cluster-management-backup` namespace.
   Wait until the installation is complete.
1. If you have clusters under management that were not created using Hive (like those manually imported).
   Edit the `MultiClusterHub` resource by setting the `managedserviceaccount` parameter to `true`.
   You can either use the graphical console for this task or run the following command line:
   ```
   oc patch MultiClusterEngine ${NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"managedserviceaccount","enabled":true}]}}}'
   ```
   This will enable the Managed Service Account component to automatically connect imported clusters when restoring a backup to a new hub cluster.
1. Create the storage location secret in the OADP Operator namespace, which is located in the backup component namespace:
   ```
   oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n open-cluster-management-backup --from-file cloud=.aws/credentials
   ```
1. Create the instance of the `DataProtectionApplication` resource:
   ```
   oc create -f DataProtectionApplication.yaml
   ```   

### On the active hub cluster:

1. Schedule a cluster backup:
   ```
   oc create -f BackupSchedule.yaml
   ```

### On the passive hub cluster:

1. Use the `restore-acm-sync` sample to restore passive data, while continuing to check if new backups are available and restore them automatically.
   To automatically restore new backups, you must set the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` parameter to `true`.
   You must also only restore the latest passive data.
   ```
   oc create -f restore-acm-sync.yaml
   ```

# Manual failover to the passive cluster

## Procedure

### On the active hub cluster:

1. To avoid getting into a backup collision state, delete the `BackupSchedule` resource on the active hub cluster before restoring managed clusters data on the passive hub cluster:
   ```
   oc delete -f BackupSchedule.yaml
   ```

### On the passive hub cluster:

1. Set the `VeleroManagedClustersBackupName` parameter to `latest`:
   ```
   oc patch restore restore-acm-sync -n open-cluster-management-backup --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"veleroManagedClustersBackupName": "latest"}}'
   ```
   Immediately after the `VeleroManagedClustersBackupName` is set to `latest`, the managed clusters are activated on the passive hub cluster and is now the primary hub cluster.
   When the activated managed cluster becomes the primary hub cluster, the `restore` resource is set to Finished and the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` is ignored, even if set to `true`.
   Wait until the `restore` resource is finished.
1. Once finished restoring the managed clusters data and to avoid getting into a backup collision state, delete the `DataProtectionApplication` resource also on the passive hub cluster:
   ```
   oc delete -f DataProtectionApplication.yaml
   ```
   Create the instance of a new `DataProtectionApplication` resource at a different storage location than the initial primary hub cluster in order to avoid collisions with the original hub cluster:
   ```
   oc create -f DataProtectionApplication2.yaml
   ```
1. Schedule a cluster backup:
   ```
   oc create -f BackupSchedule.yaml
   ```
1. After these operations the passive hub cluster becomes the new active hub cluster.

### On the original active hub cluster:

1. Create the instance of the new `DataProtectionApplication` resource at a different storage location than the initial primary hub cluster in order to avoid collisions with the original hub cluster:
   ```
   oc create -f DataProtectionApplication2.yaml
   ```   
2. Use the `restore-acm-sync` sample to restore passive data, while continuing to check if new backups are available and restore them automatically.
   To automatically restore new backups, you must set the `syncRestoreWithNewBackups` parameter to `true`.
   You must also only restore the latest passive data.
   ```
   oc create -f restore-acm-sync.yaml
   ```
